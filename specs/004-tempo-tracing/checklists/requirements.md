# Specification Quality Checklist: Tempo Distributed Tracing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Assumptions section references specific API paths (`/api/traces/{traceID}`) — these are documented as assumptions, not requirements, which is acceptable.
- Spec covers 5 user stories across 3 priority levels (P1: search + waterfall, P2: span ID search, P3: dependency map + log correlation).
- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
